# Wattpilot

### This project is still in early development and might never leave this state

`wattpilot` is a Python 3 (>= 3.9) module to interact with Fronius Wattpilot wallboxes which do not support (at the time of writting) a documented API. This functionality of this module utilized a undocumented websockets API, which is also utilized by the official Wattpilot.Solar mobile app.
